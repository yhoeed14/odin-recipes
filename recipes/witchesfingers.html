        <p> 
            This is a traditional Christmas cookie recipe that we have had in our family for years.
            All I did was change the shape to make them look like fingers for our annual Halloween party.
        </p>

            
    <P><strong> Ingredients </strong></P>

    <ul>
        <li> 1 cup butter, softened </li>
        <li> 1 cup confectioners' sugar </li>
        <li> 1 egg </li>
        <li> 1 teaspoon almond extract </li>
        <li> 1 teaspoon vanilla extract </li>
        <li> 2 ⅔ cups all-purpose flour </li>
        <li> 1 teaspoon baking powder </li>
        <li> 1 teaspoon salt </li>
        <li> ¾ cup whole almonds </li>
        <li> 1 (.75 ounce) tube red decorating gel </li>
    </ul>

<p><strong>Steps</strong></p>

    <ol>
        <li><p>
            Combine the butter, sugar, egg, almond extract, and vanilla extract in a mixing bowl.
            Beat together with an electric mixer;
            gradually add the flour, baking powder, and salt, continually beating; refrigerate 20 to 30 minutes.
        </p></li>

        <li><p>
            Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Lightly grease baking sheets.
        </p></li>

        <li><p>
            Remove dough from refrigerator in small amounts.
            Scoop 1 heaping teaspoon at a time onto a piece of waxed paper.
            Use the waxed paper to roll the dough into a thin finger-shaped cookie.
            Press one almond into one end of each cookie to give the appearance of a long fingernail.
            Squeeze cookie near the tip and again near the center of each to give the impression of knuckles.
            You can also cut into the dough with a sharp knife at the same points to help give a more finger-like appearance.
            Arrange the shaped cookies on the baking sheets.
        </p></li>

        <li><p>
            Bake in the preheated oven until the cookies are slightly golden in color, 20 to 25 minutes.
        </p></li>

        <li><p>
            Remove the almond from the end of each cookie; squeeze a small amount of red decorating gel into the cavity;
            replace the almond to cause the gel to ooze out around the tip of the cookie.
        </p></li>
    </ol>
