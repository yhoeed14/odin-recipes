    <h1>Chocolate Spiders</h1>

        <img src="../images/cookieswithspiders.jpeg" alt="Tasty chocolate spiders">

        <p> 
            I love chocolate chip cookies, so when I was baking for Halloween I turned the chocolate chips 
            into little spiders. I only drew 3 legs on each side, there wasn't room for 4, so my spiders were 
            little 6-legged creatures. 
        </p>

            <h3><strong> Ingredients </strong></h3>
    <ul>
        <li> 2 ½ cups all-purpose flour </li>
        <li> 1 teaspoon baking soda</li>
        <li> 1 teaspoon salt </li>
        <li> ½ teaspoon baking powder </li>
        <li> 1 cup unsalted butter, at room temperature </li>
        <li> ¾ cup white sugar </li>
        <li> ¾ cup packed brown sugar </li>
        <li> 2 eggs </li>
        <li> 1 teaspoon vanilla extract </li>
        <li> 2 ½ cups semisweet chocolate chips, divided </li>
    </ul>

<h3><strong>Steps</strong></h3>

    <ol>
        <li><p>
            Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
        </p></li>

        <li><p>
            Combine flour, baking soda, salt,
            and baking powder in a large bowl and stir with a fork to mix ingredients well.
       
        </p></li>

        <li><p>
            Combine butter, white sugar, and brown sugar in a large bowl;
            beat with an electric mixer until smooth and creamy.
            Add eggs and vanilla extract and beat until smooth and fluffy.
            Add in flour mixture, 1 cup at a time, and mix in with a spatula until well incorporated.
            Fold in 1 1/2 cups chocolate chips until well combined.
        </p></li>

        <li><p>
            Drop cookies onto ungreased baking sheets. Pour 1/2 cup chocolate chips into a bowl.
            Push about 3 to 4 chocolate chips onto each cookie, tip-side down, to make the spider bodies.
        </p></li>

        <li><p>
            Bake in the the preheated oven until edges are golden, 10 to 15 minutes.
            Cool on the baking sheet for 1 minute before removing to a wire rack.
        </p></li>

        <li><p>
            Melt remaining 1/2 cup chocolate in a microwave-safe glass or ceramic bowl in 15-second intervals,
            stirring after each melting, 1 to 3 minutes.
            Spoon melted chocolate into a piping bag with a small tip and draw little legs on each side of the spider bodies 
            to create spider legs.
        </p></li>
    </ol>
