<p>
    All you need for these ghost cookies is a cookie cutter in the shape 
    of a tulip and then turn it upside-down - if you don't have that one,
    you can easily freehand the ghost shapes.

<h3><strong>Ingredients</strong></h3>

    <ul>
        <li> 1 cup butter </li>
        <li> 1 ½ cups confectioners' sugar </li>
        <li> 1 egg </li>
        <li> 1 teaspoon vanilla extract </li>
        <li> 2 ½ cups all-purpose flour </li>
        <li> 1 teaspoon baking soda </li>
        <li> 1 teaspoon cream of tartar </li>
        <li> ¼ teaspoon salt </li>
    </ul>

<p><strong>Icing</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li> 1 cup confectioners' sugar </li>
        <li> 2 teaspoons milk, plus more if needed </li>
        <li> 2 teaspoons light corn syrup, or more as needed </li>
        <li> ¼ teaspoon vanilla extract </li>
        <li> 1 (12 ounce) package miniature semisweet chocolate chips </li>
    </ul>
<h3><strong>Steps</strong></h3>

    <ol>
        <li><p>
            Beat butter in a bowl with an electric mixer until creamy. Add 1 1/2 cups confectioners' sugar gradually,
            beating until light and fluffy. Beat in egg and 1 teaspoon vanilla extract.
        </p></li>

        <li><p>
            Combine flour, baking soda, cream of tartar, and salt in a second bowl.
            Add flour mixture to the creamed butter mixture and mix to combine.
            Wrap in plastic wrap and chill in the refrigerator for at least 1 hour.
        </p></li>

        <li><p>
            Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).
        </p></li>

        <li><p>
            Dust a work surface with flour and roll out dough into a thin circle. Cut out tulip shapes;
            if your tulip cookie cutter has a stem, cut the stem off with a knife,
            so you have a stemless tulip shape. Arrange cut-out cookies on ungreased baking sheets.
        </p></li>

        <li><p>
            Bake in the preheated oven until lightly browned, 6 to 8 minutes.
            Remove from baking sheets carefully and transfer to wire racks.
            Cool completely, about 15 
        </p></li>

        <li><p>
            Stir 1 cup confectioners' sugar and milk together in a small bowl until smooth.
            Beat in corn syrup and 1/4 teaspoon vanilla extract until icing is smooth and glossy.
            Add more corn syrup if icing is too thick.
        </p></li>

        <li><p>
            Spoon icing into a piping bag with a small plain tip.
            Pipe icing around the edge of each cookie to create a border.
            Fill in the middle completely with icing.
            Stick 2 chocolate chip cookies into the wet icing for the eyes.
            Let cookies stand until icing dries, about 1 hour.
        </p></li>
        
    </ol>
